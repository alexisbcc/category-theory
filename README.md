## Category

A category has Objects and arrows that go from one object to another.

### Properties of a category:

- Abstraction: Forget the implementation details and threat them as equal.

- Composition: (h o g) o f = h o (g o f)

- Identity: An object has a morphism that maps to itself

Arrows(Morphism): is a path from an object `a` to another `b`. Where objects are names for end of arrows.

a ------> b
    f
