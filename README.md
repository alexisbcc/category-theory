## Category

A category has Objects and arrows that go from one object to another.

Abstraction: Forget the implementation details and threat them as equal.

### Properties of a category:


Composition: (h o g) o f = h o (g o f)

Identity: An object has a morphism that maps to itself


Arrows(Morphism): is a path from an object A to another B. Where objects are names for end of arrows.

A ------ B
